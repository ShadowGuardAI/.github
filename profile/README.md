This is an AI-research project that focus on developing AI-generated cybersecurity tools

This project focuses on defensive action.

## New Focus: Building Defense Tools that Attack Attackers

### Project Description
This project now focuses on building defense tools that directly attack the attackers. The tools generated will not only defend but also counteract the attackers' actions, providing a proactive approach to cybersecurity.

### Importance of the New Focus
The new focus is crucial as it shifts the paradigm from passive defense to active countermeasures. By attacking the attackers, we can disrupt their operations, gather intelligence, and reduce the overall threat landscape. This proactive stance enhances the security posture and provides a more robust defense mechanism.
